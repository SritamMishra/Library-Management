📚 Library Management System (C++)

A beginner-friendly yet elegant Library Management System built in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and File Handling.
This project demonstrates how real-world systems like libraries can be represented in code while keeping the design clean, modular, and extensible.

✨ Features:

📖 Add Books → Store book details (Title, Author, Availability).
📋 View All Books → Display all books in a neat tabular format.
🔍 Search Books → Search by title or author with keyword matching.
📕 Borrow Books → Mark a book as borrowed (availability updates).
📗 Return Books → Mark a borrowed book as returned.
💾 Persistent Storage → All data is saved into a text file (library.txt) so books are not lost after closing the program.

🛠️ Concepts Used:

C++ Classes & Objects → To model Book and Library.
Vectors → For dynamic storage of books.
File Handling (ifstream, ofstream) → To save and load data.
OOP Principles → Encapsulation & modular design.
Menu-driven CLI → Beginner-friendly interface.
